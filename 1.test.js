// JS is a lightweight,
//  interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
//  programming language,
//  with first-class functions.

// While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache, CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

// JS is a prototype-based,
//  multi-paradigm,
//  single-threaded,
//  dynamic language,
//  supporting object-oriented, 
//  imperative, 
//  non declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles

// It's LIFO - last in first out - the thing that gets inside the call stack at last, that is what gets execute first
